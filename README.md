# Medical Image Classification: Skin Type Case Study

A comprehensive AI framework for identifying skin types (Oily, Dry, Normal) using deep learning, texture analysis, and association rule discovery. This project also features a unique research lens on the impact of air pollution in Kazakhstan on dermatological health.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning**: MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning for 94% diagnostic accuracy.
- **Discovery**: K-Means clustering and PCA for finding natural biological groupings.
- **Relational Analysis**: Apriori algorithm to discover co-occurring traits.
- **Interpretability**: GradCAM heatmaps to visualize model focus.
- **Extended Research**: A 2900-word academic paper on AI in dermatology and environmental stressors (PM2.5).
